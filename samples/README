This directory includes example code for Imager.

If you have sample code to contribute, please contact the maintainer.

The notes here just provide a basic description and the functions
used.

anaglyph.pl

  Produce a color, grey or pure anaglyph image given left and right
  images of a stereoscopic pair.

  Uses transform2() and convert().

interleave.pl

  Produce an interleaved image given the left and right images of a
  stereoscopic pair.  Note that the source images must be pre-scaled.

  This includes 3 different implementations, first using transform2(),
  the second using the internal i_copyto() function and the third using
  the internal i_glin() and i_plin() functions.

samp-form.cgi
samp-image.cgi

  Example that demonstrates generating an image linked from a HTML form.

  The POD for this sample discusses alternate approaches and security
  considerations.

samp-scale.html
samp-scale.cgi

  Example that demonstrates reading an image uploaded via a HTML form.

  Produces an output image scaled to fit inside 200x200.

samp-tags.html
samp-tags.cgi

  Example that demonstrates reading an image uploaded via a HTML form.

  Produces a text/plain report of the tags that Imager defined for the
  image.

  This and the previous sample are very similar, the intent is to show
  the common elements and to demonstrate that the output is independent
  of the input.

  See the section "Parsing an image posted via CGI" in Imager::Cookbook
  for cautions and details on reading uploaded images.
