-- The function pointer idea for getpixel putpixel is neat but it must be checked how
   'far' that idea should be taken - since all sorts of wierd shit like circular
   references can happen.

-- Unify file IO... probably it would be best to do something similar to streams, or just switch 
   to streams.

-- It would be nice to get the lowest version number of all the libraries the module depends on

-- Make the install more userfriendly

-- Write Docs for the lowlevel interface

-- Write the highlevel (OO) interface to the functions.

-- Enhance the font interface and add support for bitmap fonts

==============

	That is all I can think of at the moment as always ideas/fixes to addi@umich.edu
