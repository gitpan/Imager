-- The function pointer idea for getpixel putpixel is neat but it must be checked how
   'far' that idea should be taken - since all sorts of wierd shit like circular
   references can happen.

-- Most of the read and write routines leak memory at an alarming rate
   like, esp. the gif ones.

   there are two solutions to this:
	 a) make everything go through a debug malloc()
	    version that checks start and offset into a table, so we can check for memory leaks.
	 b) Have Malloc errors fatal... there probably isn't much harm in having it this way.
	    but it would be nicer if it would not die on the spot.

-- Unify file IO... probably it would be best to do something similar to streams, or just switch 
   to streams.

-- It would be nice to get the lowest version number of all the libraries the module depends on

-- Make the install more userfriendly

-- Write Docs for the lowlevel interface

-- Write the highlevel (OO) interface to the functions.

-- Enhance the font interface and add support for bitmap fonts

==============

	That is all I can think of at the moment as always ideas/fixes to addi@umich.edu
