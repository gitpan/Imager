Revision history for Perl extension Imager.

0.01  Thu May  6 15:25:03 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Mon May 10 20:20:20 1999
        - Added PPM writer, and a new return type to
	be used to return undef() from a function returning
	(int)0.

0.03  Thu May 20 23:23:23 1999
        - Added Pseudo image handling thingies, now
	you can use your own get and put pixel routines.

0.04  Mon May 24 22:14:55 1999
        - Rewrote parts of jpeg support.

0.05  Tue May 25 23:40:01 1999
	- Added png support with libpng
	fixed error reporting and return types from
	some format routines.

0.06  Wed May 26 19:05:39 1999
        - Fixed Data::Dumper being used when it shouldn't have
	added feature checking to see at run time if 
	certain formats are avaliable.
	removed some ancient C++ style comments that hadn't 
	been properly removed, some out of bounds errors in ppm.c
	fixed tests so missing features are skipped.

0.07  Thu May 27 03:15:00 1999
        - Fixed the typemap for i_img and i_color so that you can pass
	a null pointer to them without getting a warning when warnings
	are enabled. Maybe this is counter perl but it greatly increases
	the usability of the functions.

0.08   Fri May 28 14:13:21 1999
         - Added support for gif via, giflib or libungif.
	 gif is so ridden with patent issues but the user
	 can decide which library to use since they have the same
	 include files and calling interface.

0.09   Mon May 31 17:52:32 1999
         - Added image scaling per axis - faster than doing both
	 axes at the same time.  The current method uses lancoz
	 kernel and filtering. But more types should be added -
	 including: nearest neighbor, linear, and bicubic.

0.10   Mon Jun  7 03:25:54 1999
         - Added T1 postscript font handling. It's very primitive
	 at the moment but creative people can do nice stuff 
	 with it.  Currently it is not possible to have it 
	 generate an image of the correct size for a given string 
	 but that is on the way.

0.11   Mon Jun  7 14:43:35 1999
         - Added T1 features for direct to image rendering in 
	 a single color.  fixed some debug messages going to 
	 stderr instead of a log file.

0.12   Tue Jun  8 02:58:43 1999
         - Fixed bugs in jpeg.c when loading images. Also specified
	 prototype behaviour to on in the Imager.xs file. The
	 Makefile.PL step doesn't complain anymore so that is
	 hopefully fixed.

0.13   Wed Jun  9 06:55:58 1999
         - Fixed Imager.xs for init_log call.  Minor fixes here
	 and there.

0.14   Thu Jun 10 14:11:22 1999
         - Rewrote most of the logging stuff so that it is now
	 possible to remove all logging from the XS part of the
	 module.  Also some primitive check of memory usage was
	 added. Claes Jacobsson sent in some filters, inverter,
	 contrast and a noise filter.

0.15   Mon Jun 14 08:13:29 1999
	  - Wrote minor enhancement on the calling syntax list.
	  Started on the object interface - added better support
	  for quering avaliable filetypes.  Fixed memory leaks in	
	  most loaders. New filters from Claes in this version
	  are bumpmap, postlevels and mosaic.

0.16	Wed Jun 16 20:54:33 1999
	  - Added fixes to the BEGIN and END parts, added writer
	  function for the OO interface. Also added basic IPTC 
	  reading support for jpegs.  Also a few filters have been
	  added to the OO interface.

0.17	Thu Jun 24 11:09:15 1999
	  - Added dynamic loading stuff - It's still missing a nice
	  global symbol table. This will be fixed in next release.
	  also calling the plugins is not all to easy at the moment.


0.18	Mon Jun 28 12:31:33 1999
	  - Added global symbol table - plugins now need a symbol
	  table pointer in them. When the module is loaded it is
	  set to point at the global symbol table. Also some barebones
	  Makefile.PL has been made in the dynfilt directory - it works
	  on my system - I hope it does on yours.


0.19	Fri Jul  1 15:00:03 1999	
	  - Added a way new scaling method for creating easy previews.
	  It only uses nearest neighbor, so it's doesn't look very nice
	  but it may be better for applications like remote sensing.

0.20	Mon Jul  5 10:15:37 1999
	  - Added and rewrote documentation.

0.21	Mon Jul  6 19:15:37 1999
	  - Fixed a bug in the scaling routine - it wasn't
	  handling 0< cases.

0.22	Sat Oct  9 07:04:14 1999
	  - Added a new method to write gif images - now 
	  it is possible to have a part of a palette fixed.
	  this is very usefull if one needs to make sure that
	  some color like white is in the pallete.  This method
	  also allows some ditherding and gives better colormap
	  than the mediancut from the gif libraries.  It does
	  need much more cpu power though.  Hopefully later versions
	  will be faster.

0.23	**************** Internal release only
	  - Fixed the %instances bug - caused ALL memory to be leaked.
	  Added real noise function - need feedback on how it should
	  be used. Also box(), and polyline are now in place.  Polygon
	  is missing but antialiased line drawing with integer endpoints are
          done but should be replaced with a version that can have 
	  floating point endvalues. Two noise filters addded.

0.24	**************** Internal release only
	  - Converted i_color into an object from a reference, so now it's
	giving an object instead of a void ptr or an integer or something.

0.25	**************** Internal release only
	  - Added basic Truetype functionality - still needs a rewrite
	to be decent. Currently it's a port of a demo program that
	uses an awful amount of global variables and there is much IO since
	no caching of glyphs is done.

0.26    Tue Nov 23 03:57:00 EST 1999 > Development release <
	  - Added transformations so that an image can be wrapped.
	To achive decent speed a C based stackmachine is included. As a result
	transformations need to be specified in rpn (postfix) notation. It
	also can use the Affix::Infix2Postfix class to do the conversion for it.

0.27    Tue Dec 28 03:57:00 EST 1999
	  - This is a bugfix version mostly, thanks to claes for pointing
	out the problems - fixed palette saving wasn't working correctly after
	version 0.24 - rather surprised this didn't crash everything.
	Also fixed that for t1 fonts the bounding box wasn't being reported 
	unless the font had been used before.  This is either a bug in t1lib
	or a mistake in it's documentation.  Another lingering bug since 0.24
	what that $img->box() wasn't creating it's default color properly.
	Added i_tt_text() method and more debuging to the truetype routines.      	
	truetype testcase fixed and old debug rubish removed.

0.28    Tue Jan  4 05:25:58 EST 2000
	  - Only fixes to truetype test and transformation tests.
	Thanks to schinder of cpan testers for testing and reporting.
