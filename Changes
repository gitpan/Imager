Imager release history.  Older releases can be found in Changes.old

Imager 0.57 - 30 Apr 2007
===========

This is a maintenence release fixing a security issue in Imager.

 - CRITICAL: a specially crafted compressed BMP file can cause a buffer
   overflow in malloced memory.  There will be further discussion of
   this issue in the ticket below.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26811

Imager 0.56 - 1 Apr 2007
===========

 - added support for reading 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - improved performance of reading PBM/PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing PBM images if the image is paletted and
   contains only black and white

 - added a new make_colors value - "mono"

 - switched from the svn log Changes to a manual Changes to reduce
   noise

 - new sample code - samples/flasher.pl

Bug fixes:

 - CRITICAL: the "Imager" typemap entry (not used by Imager itself)
   was returning an image object with an extra reference, this
   resulted in a memory leak.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24992

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 2.x driver
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reading bmp files now consitently handles short reads.  You can now
   supply a parameter to treat a short read as successful and set
   i_incomplete
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8426

 - previously, reading ASCII PBM files required spaces between samples,
   even though the format doesn't require that

 - improved documentation of the unsharpmask filter (I hope)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25531

 - force flushing of the output from i_tt_dump_names() and test output
   in t/t35ttfont.t to prevent output from being mixed up.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24859

 - rewrite a conditional expression as an if() to hopefully work around
   a bug in the pre-4.0 GCC Apple shipped with OS X 10.4.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25561

 - avoid Data::Dumper in regops.perl to support older releases of perl
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24391

Imager 0.55 - 16 Dec 2006
===========

This is primarily a bug fix release.

Note: Test::More is now a pre-requisite for Imager and is no longer bundled.

There is one new feature:

 - the Win32 font driver now supports UTF8 (RT 22166)
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22166

Several bugs were fixed:

 - the string() method would not output the string "0"
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - fills.c was failing to compile on Solaris 10 (compiler unknown)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21944

 - the gif_disposal and gif_user_input tags weren't being read from
   the file correctly
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=22192

 - gif.c was failing to build under MSVC
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23922

 - in some cases strings passed to the string() method were treated as
   terminated by NUL (chr 0)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - on "MSWin32" perl builds we now link to -lzlib instead of -lz since
   that's the default build name for zlib on Win32.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23064

 - search $Config{incpath} for headers too, which we should have been
   doing all along.

Win32 font driver fixes:

 - the global descent value from bounding box was the wrong sign
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276

 - if the first or last glyph overflowed the left or right side of the
   advance width they would be clipped


Imager 0.54 - 14 Sep 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release:

 - a new qtype value 'mixing' has been added to the scale()
   method. This is faster than 'normal', slower than 'preview'. This
   is based on the method used by pnmscale, and seems to produce less
   blurry results than normal.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20677

 - the rubthrough() method can now render onto images with an alpha
   channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20678

 - the read_multi() method now falls back to calling doing a single
   image read via the read() method and write_multi() will now fall
   back to calling write() if a single image is supplied. This means
   you can simply call the read_multi() or write_multi() functions
   without having to check if the type is formatted by that method.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19457
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19458

 - the GIF loop extension can now be written. If you don't have
   libungif/giflib 4.1.4 (or some distribution's bugfixed equivalent) you
   should upgrade.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21185

 - getscanline() and setscanline() can now read/write palette index
   based data from/to the image for paletted images, by setting type to
   'index'.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20338

 - we no longer hassle you to disable GIF support
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20687

 - minor documentation fixes


Imager 0.53 - 26 Jul 2006
===========

This is a bugfix release.

Some test code was left in a code path not covered by the test
suite. A test was added to cover this code path and the test code was
removed.
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20705


Imager 0.52 - 25 Jul 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release, but contains a fair few bug
fixes, new features:

 - ability to read and write MS Windows ICO and CUR files

 - you can now add file format plugins to support new file formats

 - add POD coverage tests

 - setcolors() and addcolors() now accept color names and so on
   instead of requiring Imager::Color objects.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20056

 - flood_fill() can now fill to a specified border color instead of
   just to the area the same color as the seed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19618


Bug fixes:

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't converting UTF8 to ascii when
   calculating the advance width.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20554

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't including leading and
   trailing spaces in the bounding box as the other drivers did, it also
   produced strange results for empty strings or strings containing only
   spaces

 - when reading CMYK jpeg images they were being transferred to the
   image object as is, producing a four channel image. It only looked ok
   due to an old still unfixed Photoshop bug. We now convert from the
   inverted CMYK that photoshop (and Corel for example) produce into RGB.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20416

 - reading a CYMK TIFF would result in a 4 channel image, reading any
   image with more than 4 channels (eg. RGB with 2 alpha channels) would
   result in an error.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20415

 - added /usr/local/include to the default include search path, since
   we were already searching /usr/local/lib for libraries.

And various minor fixes and documentation updates.


Imager 0.51 - 23 Apr 2006
===========

 - fix a validation bug when processing JPEG EXIF data that can cause
   a crash
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18496

 - fix mis-processing of the src_maxx and src_maxy parameters of the
   paste() method
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18712

 - fix a problem in Imager's "smart" handling of the color parameter
   to various methods.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18561


Imager 0.50 - 29 Mar 2006
===========

 - CRITICAL: fixes a segmentation fault from attempting to write a 2
   or 4 channel image to jpeg or a 2 channel image to tga where the
   output is an in-memeory buffer.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18397

 - fixes an incorrect pointer parameter in the PNG code
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18051

 - skip Inline::C tests when building in a directory with spaces
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18049
