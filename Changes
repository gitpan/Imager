Revision history for Perl extension Imager.

0.01  Thu May  6 15:25:03 1999
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Mon May 10 20:20:20 1999
        - Added PPM writer, and a new return type to
        be used to return undef() from a function returning
        (int)0.

0.03  Thu May 20 23:23:23 1999
        - Added Pseudo image handling thingies, now
        you can use your own get and put pixel routines.

0.04  Mon May 24 22:14:55 1999
        - Rewrote parts of jpeg support.

0.05  Tue May 25 23:40:01 1999
        - Added png support with libpng
        fixed error reporting and return types from
        some format routines.

0.06  Wed May 26 19:05:39 1999
        - Fixed Data::Dumper being used when it shouldn't have
        added feature checking to see at run time if 
        certain formats are avaliable.
        removed some ancient C++ style comments that hadn't 
        been properly removed, some out of bounds errors in ppm.c
        fixed tests so missing features are skipped.

0.07  Thu May 27 03:15:00 1999
        - Fixed the typemap for i_img and i_color so that you can pass
        a null pointer to them without getting a warning when warnings
        are enabled. Maybe this is counter perl but it greatly increases
        the usability of the functions.

0.08   Fri May 28 14:13:21 1999
         - Added support for gif via, giflib or libungif.
         gif is so ridden with patent issues but the user
         can decide which library to use since they have the same
         include files and calling interface.

0.09   Mon May 31 17:52:32 1999
         - Added image scaling per axis - faster than doing both
         axes at the same time.  The current method uses lancoz
         kernel and filtering. But more types should be added -
         including: nearest neighbor, linear, and bicubic.

0.10   Mon Jun  7 03:25:54 1999
         - Added T1 postscript font handling. It's very primitive
         at the moment but creative people can do nice stuff 
         with it.  Currently it is not possible to have it 
         generate an image of the correct size for a given string 
         but that is on the way.

0.11   Mon Jun  7 14:43:35 1999
         - Added T1 features for direct to image rendering in 
         a single color.  fixed some debug messages going to 
         stderr instead of a log file.

0.12   Tue Jun  8 02:58:43 1999
         - Fixed bugs in jpeg.c when loading images. Also specified
         prototype behaviour to on in the Imager.xs file. The
         Makefile.PL step doesn't complain anymore so that is
         hopefully fixed.

0.13   Wed Jun  9 06:55:58 1999
         - Fixed Imager.xs for init_log call.  Minor fixes here
         and there.

0.14   Thu Jun 10 14:11:22 1999
         - Rewrote most of the logging stuff so that it is now
         possible to remove all logging from the XS part of the
         module.  Also some primitive check of memory usage was
         added. Claes Jacobsson sent in some filters, inverter,
         contrast and a noise filter.

0.15   Mon Jun 14 08:13:29 1999
          - Wrote minor enhancement on the calling syntax list.
          Started on the object interface - added better support
          for quering avaliable filetypes.  Fixed memory leaks in       
          most loaders. New filters from Claes in this version
          are bumpmap, postlevels and mosaic.

0.16    Wed Jun 16 20:54:33 1999
          - Added fixes to the BEGIN and END parts, added writer
          function for the OO interface. Also added basic IPTC 
          reading support for jpegs.  Also a few filters have been
          added to the OO interface.

0.17    Thu Jun 24 11:09:15 1999
          - Added dynamic loading stuff - It's still missing a nice
          global symbol table. This will be fixed in next release.
          also calling the plugins is not all to easy at the moment.


0.18    Mon Jun 28 12:31:33 1999
          - Added global symbol table - plugins now need a symbol
          table pointer in them. When the module is loaded it is
          set to point at the global symbol table. Also some barebones
          Makefile.PL has been made in the dynfilt directory - it works
          on my system - I hope it does on yours.


0.19    Fri Jul  1 15:00:03 1999        
          - Added a way new scaling method for creating easy previews.
          It only uses nearest neighbor, so it's doesn't look very nice
          but it may be better for applications like remote sensing.

0.20    Mon Jul  5 10:15:37 1999
          - Added and rewrote documentation.

0.21    Mon Jul  6 19:15:37 1999
          - Fixed a bug in the scaling routine - it wasn't
          handling 0< cases.

0.22    Sat Oct  9 07:04:14 1999
          - Added a new method to write gif images - now 
          it is possible to have a part of a palette fixed.
          this is very usefull if one needs to make sure that
          some color like white is in the pallete.  This method
          also allows some ditherding and gives better colormap
          than the mediancut from the gif libraries.  It does
          need much more cpu power though.  Hopefully later versions
          will be faster.

0.23    **************** Internal release only
          - Fixed the %instances bug - caused ALL memory to be leaked.
          Added real noise function - need feedback on how it should
          be used. Also box(), and polyline are now in place.  Polygon
          is missing but antialiased line drawing with integer endpoints are
          done but should be replaced with a version that can have 
          floating point endvalues. Two noise filters addded.

0.24    **************** Internal release only
          - Converted i_color into an object from a reference, so now it's
        giving an object instead of a void ptr or an integer or something.

0.25    **************** Internal release only
          - Added basic Truetype functionality - still needs a rewrite
        to be decent. Currently it's a port of a demo program that
        uses an awful amount of global variables and there is much IO since
        no caching of glyphs is done.

0.26    Tue Nov 23 03:57:00 1999 > Development release <
          - Added transformations so that an image can be wrapped.
        To achive decent speed a C based stackmachine is included. As a result
        transformations need to be specified in rpn (postfix) notation. It
        also can use the Affix::Infix2Postfix class to do the conversion for it.

0.27    Tue Dec 28 03:57:00 1999 > CPAN release <
          - This is a bugfix version mostly, thanks to claes for pointing
        out the problems - fixed palette saving wasn't working correctly after
        version 0.24 - rather surprised this didn't crash everything.
        Also fixed that for t1 fonts the bounding box wasn't being reported 
        unless the font had been used before.  This is either a bug in t1lib
        or a mistake in it's documentation.  Another lingering bug since 0.24
        what that $img->box() wasn't creating it's default color properly.
        Added i_tt_text() method and more debuging to the truetype routines.            
        truetype testcase fixed and old debug rubish removed.

0.28    Tue Jan  4 05:25:58 2000 > CPAN release <
          - Only fixes to truetype test and transformation tests.
        Thanks to schinder of cpan testers for testing and reporting.

0.29    Tue Jan  4 21:49:57 2000 > CPAN release <
          - fixes to get rid of warnings under pre 5.005, 
        Fixed broken preproccessor directives to work on non gnu
        compilers.  Fixed DSO test on HPUX - both code errors and
        HPUX creates .sl instead of .so so the tests were failing.

0.30    Sun Jan  7 05:00:06 2000 > Bunch of Alpha releases <
          - An attempt to automate installation.

0.31    Sat Jan 15 03:58:29 2000 > Fixes fixes fixes <
          - Fixed a bug pointed out by Leolo where loading gifs
        skips the first line of the imageload() has been
        by read() - for now load is an alias for read.  It will
        be removed in the future.  Also, fixes dynamic loading on
        systems that prepend an underscore to symbols.  At the present
        the only system that I know of that needs this is OpenBSD.
        BUT YOU MUST RECOMPILE ALL OF YOUR OLD MODULES AGAINST THIS BUILD.
        Added getchannels() method ( How did I manage to delay this
        untill now ).  Some document changes but nothing substantial.
        Also fixed the png read/write routines to handle all colorspaces
        and images with alpha information.  Also now it's possible to 
        have Imager guess the format of the files to load or save 
        when passing files to read or save from the filename.
        Also all of the tests except dynamic loading now pass on OS/2.

0.32    Tue Feb 29 17:26:00 2000 CPAN RELEASE
          - Added the getcolorcount method.  Fixed interlace handling
        on png images.  Fixed the missing channel count in crop()
        method. Rewrote most of t1lib database stuff - created color
        and font classes.  T1 stuff is mostly done - TT things were
        rewritten too and now include most of what is needed for
        pixmap caching.  Added documentation for fonts.  Comments have
        been added to some of the relevant c-routines.  Added a copy()
        function in Imager.xs and a corresponding method name.
        Changed the underlying data type for the raw XS images from
        pointers to objects - this will hopefully catch the most
        basic errors and keep the segfaulting down.  This means that
        all of the underlying XS calls for readjpeg, readgif, readpng 
        and readraw do not take the first parameter any more.  
        Made fixes to keep it not spewing warning on 5.004 perl.        

        **** If you had any code that didn't use the OO interface ****
        ****         It will probably not work any longer         ****
        
0.33    Beta -- No final
          - Fixed the end message from Imager 0.32.  Destroy called
        on an empty image.  Did some work on the polygon method.  
        Some clean up in the Makefile.PL script.  Fixed a buffer
        overrun in the t_transform in Imager.XS.  Fixed the 
        error handling in the jpeg loader.  It now correctly
        returns undef if a load on an image fails.  It also 
        sends the error messages to the log file.  Added errstr()
        method to the image object.  Added a new way to read()
        objects from scalars.  So far this is only implemented for
        jpeg, png and gif.  ppm and raw soon - as always if someone
        wants to do an overhaul on the ppm stuff feel free.  It seems
        like such a basic format that interfacing with a library is more
        work than implementing all of the needed routines instead.

0.34    Beta -- No final
          - Bunch of documentation fixes, backed out ppm code.
        Put in TonyC's giant transform2 patch.  Fixed the patch
        to make it ansi compliant.  Fixed a bunch of bugs in the
        Freetype code with regard to vertical and horizontal 
        positioning and bounding boxes.  Cleaned up a lot of the
        code so it runs under -Wall.  Code that is still in 
        development such as the polygon converter do not compile
        cleanly.  Fixed the non antialiased versions of truetype
        dump to image routines.  Also removed the FIXME for the 
        hardcoding of antialias in the Imager string method.
        Fixed sign error and a missing cache of the bounding box
        calculation for the rasterize function.  Removed some
        debugging code I forgot to remove.  Added iolayer.h
        and iolayer.c but they don't do anything for now.
        
0.35    pre2 -- No time yet
          - Fixed some compile warnings for various files under -Wall.
        Added functionality for jpeg reading of seekable files, it's not
        really working yet.  This version is pretty much *not* working.
        Do not install unless you intend to do a lot of development.
        Repeat - it doesn't even pass tests (but it compiles).  Ok now reading
        jpegs works from scalars, my guess is that it also works from non
        seeking sources such as sockets or pipes.

0.35  pre3 - No time yet
          - Added the *right* patch from Tony which combines
        the common code from i_readgif and i_readgif_scalar into
        i_readgif_low.  Added tiff reading support through iolayer.

0.35  pre4 - No time yet
          - Added tiff writing (no options) support through
        iolayer.  Also made some small fixes for the iolayer reading
        (was always doing two reads when one was needed).  Patched the
        Imager::read() call so that it now uses a mixture of old and new
        functions.  

0.35  pre5 - No time yet
          - Fixed various gnu'isms in the c code (some bugs in the link list
        implmentation).  Fixed missing #skip codes when gif format is not
        present in any form.  Added fixes for 5.004_04 in the transform2 function.
        Made sure it compiles cleanly with sun's cc.  Switched from a .jpeg
        for transform2 check to a .ppm file so it runs when jpeg is not 
        present.  Added a test for tiff files in t10formats.t.


0.35  pre6 - No time yet
          - Fixes to Makefile.PL.  Should find freetype includes on more
        distributions now.  Ran tests on Solaris and Hpux, minor fixes.
        Compiles with some warnings on with both hpux and solaris' cc.  
        Made some minor changes to the documentation.  Fixes to tiff.c log
        code.

0.35  pre7 - No time yet
          - Fixes 64 bit bug on freebsd.  While libtiff mirrors the effects of
        lseek it's toff_t is a uint32, while lseek uses off_t which can be a 64
        bit quantity.  Added the IM_LFLAGS environment variable to help
        people with broken libgifs (that want to link with X).

0.35  Sun Jan 28 19:42:59 EST 2001
          - More makefile fixes, fixed a few signedness warnings.  
        Checked to see if it compiled cleanly on Solaris and HPUX.
        Fixed a 5.004_04 warning and added more ENV flags for makefile.

0.36    Mon Jan 29 09:36:11 EST 2001
          - String as 0 or "" caused an error in $img->string().  Fixed a 
        documentation error invoving string() method syntax.  Merged a patch
        for non antialised truetype fonts.  Fixed an error in the Makefile.PL
        which caused a makefile to be generated that bombed with sgi's make.

0.37    Mon Tue 30 09:36:11 EST 2001
          - Several documentation fixes.  Pod documentation for almost every
        function in image.c.  Added sys/types.h include in iolayer which was
        causing problems on various linux systems.

0.38    pre1 - No time yet
          - Fixed a braindamaged fix on the Makefile.PL file.  Moved the 
        code for Imager::Color into lib/Imager/Color.pm.  Wrote some pod
        about how it works.  Made the names of Imager::Color XS routines
        all begin with ICL_ and used the prefix rules of XS to get nice names
        in perl.  Found a bug (not fixed) in how XS handles 
        returning an object to an object it had as a parameter (double
        free).  

0.38    pre2 - No time yet
          - Fixes lots of for documentation, patch for freetype bounding
        box handling.  Split put code for Imager::Font into Font.pm and added
        more documentation for Font.pm.  Added string local ascender and
        descender for tt fonts.  Note that this needs to be added to t1 fonts
        before 0.38 final.

0.38    pre3 - No time yet
          - Fixed an in consistency in the bounding box functions for t1
        fonts.  Now both versions get the 6 argument bounding_box method
        described in Imager::Font.  Started converting the comments in 
        font.c so that they are viewable by doco.perl.  Added two examples
        of filters.  Need to make them more usefull and then add more
        notes than are in compile.txt.


0.38    pre4 - No time yet
          - Completed adding pod comments to font.c, tiff.c and iolayer.c.
        Those along with image.c should now have every single function 
        described in pod format.

0.38    pre5 - No time yet
          - Replaced ppm.c with pnm.c which adds support for pbm/pgm/ppm
        files ascii and binary formats.  Added patches for the gif routines.
        Patched some of the color quantizing routines (Leolo and TonyC).
        There is one bomb and one warning in this test, and frankly I don't
        see why they are suddenly there.

0.38    pre6 - No time yet
          - Patch from Tony that fixes infix when Parse::RecDescent is present.
        Checked some cases where malloc/free were used instead of mymalloc/myfree.
        Added bufchain iolayer code.  You can now write to a chain of buffers and
        later slurp it all into a single perl scalar.  Found some oddity of t/t10
        test not giving the right return value when malloc debugging was enabled.
        Fixed some of the logging code and the malloc debugging options.  Added 
        more tests for tiffs.

0.38    pre7 - No time yet
          - Added i_gradgen code and put it into the filters hash.  Think a
        seperate pod for filters would be a good idea.  Also removed some of the
        debugging code from the iolayer.  Added pod comments to filters.c and
        looked over the code.

0.38    pre8 - No time yet
          - limited Win32 support, Imager installs and builds using VC++,
        but there's no image/font format support yet.

0.38  pre9 - No time yet
          - Added lots of color quantization code from Tony with benchmarks.
        Also fixes ugly stack overrun in old version.  Added fixes for the lmfixed
        problem.  Four of them, let's see which is fastest.  This version adds
        some voronoi partitioning - it's dog slow but it's a reference implementation
        to check if faster algorithms are doing the right thing [tm].  Added a check
        for giflib 3.
        - Win32 support for libpng
        - fixed set_internal creating 2 refs to one object
        - Win32 support for jpeg
        - Win32 support for tiff
        - base level error reporting code added, I still need to modify
          older code to use it
        - fix translate=>'giflib' handling of single-colour images.  
          Previously a single colour image would cause an error in 
          MakeMapObject().
        - fix t/t10formats.t tests against giflib3
        - added test for transparent gifs
        - minor doc fixes for transparent gifs
        - make it less error-prone to write transparent gifs
        - documented the options for reading raw images
        - Changes switched to use spaces for formatting
        - switch gif.c to new error reporting with related changes to
          Imager.xs, Imager.pm
        - each of the image formats now have their own test file,
          extracted from t10formats.t, usually with som extra tests
        - Added flip() and docs to Imager.pm and i_flipxy to image.c.
          Added testcases too.
        - Fixed an overflow bug in png.c
        - added the colors parameter to Imager::read() which receives 
          the arrayref of colours that i_readgif(_scalar) returns
        - fixed a problem in makemap_addi in quant.c where only the first
          image was compared against the palette when the palette was being 
          refined.  I screwed up on this originally (TC).  This is the other
          half of a fix for Leolo's lmfixed problem <sigh>.
        - makemap_addi() now only puts colours into the palette that it
          found while optimizing the palette (so we don't get 256 colour
          palettes for 2 colour images :)
        - initial implementation of a row-based interface to low-level
          images (for performance)
        - changed Imager::read() for GIF so that the arrayref pointed to 
          by the ref supplied in colors contains Imager::Color objects 
          instead of more arrayrefs, keep this interface stable until we 
          can make an informed choice about i_readgif()
        - incorporated Micksa's faxable tiff support, treating as a type
          of tiff rather than a separate format
        - t/t70newgif.t now checks for gif support
        - added the convert() method
        - Added support for transparent to alpha conversion during loading
          of png files.  Note that libpng 1.0.1 is broken in handling this,
	        we know that 1.0.5 works.
        - support for writing PGM (portable gray map) files
        - Fix for i_gifread_low() for images with only a local and no global
          colormap and an abort if no colormap is present (which is legal
          in gif).
        - several fixes to i_readgif_low()
	- Fixed crop() method so that it is consistent with documentation.
        - make clean now removes the testout directory
	- added tests for the OO interface for tiff, added an option to
