Imager release history.  Older releases can be found in Changes.old

Imager 0.61_02 - 28 November 2007
==============

 - major TIFF support re-work
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20329

 - added a C level image interface for accessing samples from 1-32
   bits, exposed this at the perl level in getsamples()

 - the conv filter now works at floating point precision for high bit
   images

 - added is_bilevel method to test whether an image should be written as
   a bilevel image if the image format supports it.

 - added -log-stderr as an Imager import list option

 - added some important types to Imager::APIRef

 - added test_image_double() to Imager::Test

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Fountain couldn't read GIMP gradient files with 10 or more
   segments

 - the scale() method with qtype mixing now handles images with an
   alpha channel correctly.

 - fixed a broken link from the "animated GIF" entry in the concept index.
   Thanks to Slaven Rezic.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30889

 - on some perl's the infix expression parser test would fail due to
   actions in the grammar returning false.  Made sure all actions return
   a true value.
   Thanks to Richard Fairhurst for spending a lot of time in tracking
   down this problem.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29562

Imager 0.61 - 5 November 2007
===========

 - added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags
   when scaling an animated gif
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27591

Bug fixes:

 - correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow
   perspective type transformations to work now.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29936

 - prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c
   also fixed some other type warnings
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30204

 - some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent
   directory tests
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30203

 - Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos
   thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29771

 - test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to
   use long double.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29413

 - the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break.
   Added tests for better code coverage of the ops.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29296

 - the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30334

 - the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values
   under 0x10000.  This was most noticable when writing large RLE images.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30335

 - validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp()
   implementations.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28985

 - attempt to work around the test failure at 
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29562

 - improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write
   an unknown image file format.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30103

 - improve the transform2() documentation
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29267

 - correctly generate the author key in META.yml
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30377

 - correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when
   performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel.
   Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output
   image.

Imager 0.60 - 30 August 2007
===========

 - Finished/rewrote Arnar's old SGI RGB file format support, so Imager
   now has full SGI RGB image format, including RLE and 16-bit/sample
   images.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8666

 - logging functions are now available in the API

 - applied Gabriel Vasseur's patch
   added documentation, further tests, and support for greyscale images
   Obviously problems are my fault :)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28142

 - the mask for ICO/CUR images is now applied as an alpha channel to
   the returned image.  For the old behaviour, supply ico_masked => 0
   to read() or read_multi().  This should be less confusing when
   using Imager as a general image processor.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29001

Bug fixes:

 - in some cases it's possible for giflib/libungif to return color 
   indexes outside the range of colors defined by the image's palette.
   We now expand the palette to match the indexes used.
   Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this.

 - fixed various memory leaks that could occur when failing to read png,
   jpeg, bmp or tga files.

 - to avoid confusion, channels not present in the image are returned as
   zero by getscanline().  This has no effect on the C level i_glin()
   and i_glinf() API functions which continue to not set the unused
   channels.

 - the convert() method now returns an image of the same sample size as
   the source image.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28492

 - remove repeated text in Imager::Files
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27589

 - be even more explicit that scale() and friends don't modify the source
   image, but return a new image.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28570

 - improve the error message from errstr() when you try to load a font
   for which the driver hasn't been built in Imager.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27571

 - transparency is now enabled by default when writing GIF images
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27615

 - Imager would not load on Windows 98
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27653

Imager 0.59 - 14 June 2007
===========

Bug fixes:

 - fixes a regression introduced by the fixes for RT 11972
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27546

 - cropping outside the image would return an Imager object with
   no low-level image object, instead of returning false.
   Fixed by: Philip Gwyn (Leolo)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27509

Imager 0.58 - 16 May 2007
===========

No significant changes from 0.57_01.

Imager 0.57_01 - 11 May 2007
==============

 - added to_rgb16 to produce a 16-bit/sample version of an image

 - improve freetype 1.x text output efficiency

Bug fixes:

 - search another place for rgb.txt, and check all the places 
   Imager::Color checks when deciding whether to skip testing it
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26064

 - use a convolution kernel size based on the stddev rather than a
   fixed size when performing a gaussian blur
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25645

 - document the difference() method's mindist parameter, and debug it.

 - put the Imager release number in the Inline::C generated code to
   regenerate Inline code when a new release of Imager is installed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26278

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 1.x driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the T1lib driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reworked library probing, we can now set more than one probe
   function for a library.  Disabled the default (non-freetype-config)
   library probe and added an extra probe function that searches for
   both ft2build.h and whatever it includes, and adds -I as needed.
   Hopefully this will fix build problems like
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/05/msg472281.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26086

Imager 0.57 - 30 Apr 2007
===========

This is a maintenence release fixing a security issue in Imager.

 - CRITICAL: a specially crafted compressed BMP file can cause a buffer
   overflow in malloced memory.  There will be further discussion of
   this issue in the ticket below.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26811
   CVE-2007-2459  CVE-2007-2413
   The descriptions at cve.mitre.org varied in quality, please see the
   ticket at rt.cpan.org for a more accurate description of the issue.

Imager 0.56 - 1 Apr 2007
===========

 - added support for reading 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - improved performance of reading PBM/PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing PBM images if the image is paletted and
   contains only black and white

 - added a new make_colors value - "mono"

 - switched from the svn log Changes to a manual Changes to reduce
   noise

 - new sample code - samples/flasher.pl

Bug fixes:

 - CRITICAL: the "Imager" typemap entry (not used by Imager itself)
   was returning an image object with an extra reference, this
   resulted in a memory leak.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24992

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 2.x driver
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reading bmp files now consitently handles short reads.  You can now
   supply a parameter to treat a short read as successful and set
   i_incomplete
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8426

 - previously, reading ASCII PBM files required spaces between samples,
   even though the format doesn't require that

 - improved documentation of the unsharpmask filter (I hope)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25531

 - force flushing of the output from i_tt_dump_names() and test output
   in t/t35ttfont.t to prevent output from being mixed up.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24859

 - rewrite a conditional expression as an if() to hopefully work around
   a bug in the pre-4.0 GCC Apple shipped with OS X 10.4.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25561

 - avoid Data::Dumper in regops.perl to support older releases of perl
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24391

Imager 0.55 - 16 Dec 2006
===========

This is primarily a bug fix release.

Note: Test::More is now a pre-requisite for Imager and is no longer bundled.

There is one new feature:

 - the Win32 font driver now supports UTF8 (RT 22166)
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22166

Several bugs were fixed:

 - the string() method would not output the string "0"
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - fills.c was failing to compile on Solaris 10 (compiler unknown)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21944

 - the gif_disposal and gif_user_input tags weren't being read from
   the file correctly
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=22192

 - gif.c was failing to build under MSVC
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23922

 - in some cases strings passed to the string() method were treated as
   terminated by NUL (chr 0)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - on "MSWin32" perl builds we now link to -lzlib instead of -lz since
   that's the default build name for zlib on Win32.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23064

 - search $Config{incpath} for headers too, which we should have been
   doing all along.

Win32 font driver fixes:

 - the global descent value from bounding box was the wrong sign
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276

 - if the first or last glyph overflowed the left or right side of the
   advance width they would be clipped


Imager 0.54 - 14 Sep 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release:

 - a new qtype value 'mixing' has been added to the scale()
   method. This is faster than 'normal', slower than 'preview'. This
   is based on the method used by pnmscale, and seems to produce less
   blurry results than normal.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20677

 - the rubthrough() method can now render onto images with an alpha
   channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20678

 - the read_multi() method now falls back to calling doing a single
   image read via the read() method and write_multi() will now fall
   back to calling write() if a single image is supplied. This means
   you can simply call the read_multi() or write_multi() functions
   without having to check if the type is formatted by that method.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19457
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19458

 - the GIF loop extension can now be written. If you don't have
   libungif/giflib 4.1.4 (or some distribution's bugfixed equivalent) you
   should upgrade.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21185

 - getscanline() and setscanline() can now read/write palette index
   based data from/to the image for paletted images, by setting type to
   'index'.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20338

 - we no longer hassle you to disable GIF support
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20687

 - minor documentation fixes


Imager 0.53 - 26 Jul 2006
===========

This is a bugfix release.

Some test code was left in a code path not covered by the test
suite. A test was added to cover this code path and the test code was
removed.
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20705


Imager 0.52 - 25 Jul 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release, but contains a fair few bug
fixes, new features:

 - ability to read and write MS Windows ICO and CUR files

 - you can now add file format plugins to support new file formats

 - add POD coverage tests

 - setcolors() and addcolors() now accept color names and so on
   instead of requiring Imager::Color objects.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20056

 - flood_fill() can now fill to a specified border color instead of
   just to the area the same color as the seed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19618


Bug fixes:

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't converting UTF8 to ascii when
   calculating the advance width.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20554

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't including leading and
   trailing spaces in the bounding box as the other drivers did, it also
   produced strange results for empty strings or strings containing only
   spaces

 - when reading CMYK jpeg images they were being transferred to the
   image object as is, producing a four channel image. It only looked ok
   due to an old still unfixed Photoshop bug. We now convert from the
   inverted CMYK that photoshop (and Corel for example) produce into RGB.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20416

 - reading a CYMK TIFF would result in a 4 channel image, reading any
   image with more than 4 channels (eg. RGB with 2 alpha channels) would
   result in an error.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20415

 - added /usr/local/include to the default include search path, since
   we were already searching /usr/local/lib for libraries.

And various minor fixes and documentation updates.


Imager 0.51 - 23 Apr 2006
===========

 - fix a validation bug when processing JPEG EXIF data that can cause
   a crash
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18496

 - fix mis-processing of the src_maxx and src_maxy parameters of the
   paste() method
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18712

 - fix a problem in Imager's "smart" handling of the color parameter
   to various methods.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18561


Imager 0.50 - 29 Mar 2006
===========

 - CRITICAL: fixes a segmentation fault from attempting to write a 2
   or 4 channel image to jpeg or a 2 channel image to tga where the
   output is an in-memeory buffer.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18397

 - fixes an incorrect pointer parameter in the PNG code
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18051

 - skip Inline::C tests when building in a directory with spaces
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18049
