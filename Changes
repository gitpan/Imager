Imager release history.  Older releases can be found in Changes.old

Imager 0.82 - 14 Mar 2011
===========

Bug fixes:

 - eliminate calls to i_has_format() from the test suite, since it's
   no longer a useful way to check for file format support.  Eliminate
   i_has_format() from the functions exposed via XS.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65863

 - eliminate calls to note(), which isn't in the (very old) version of
   Test::More we have as a pre-requisite.  note() is modern enough
   that I don't feel a need to require a Test::More upgrade for it.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65864

 - skip the threads tests on Test::More 2.00_*
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65812

 - add an (unshipped) test to check Imager's internal POD links
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65749

 - improve the library detection summary
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9675

 - increase the version of Imager::Font::Type1 so that upgrades don't
   downgrade the version in this file.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=66250

 - if we see an -rpath (or -R) option in $Config{lddlflags} supply
   that option for the directories that would normally go in
   LD_RUN_PATH.  Typically an explicit -rpath overrides LD_RUN_PATH.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65955

Imager 0.81 - 14 Feb 2011
===========

 - added coverage tests for masked images (maskimg.c @100% test coverage)

 - add hsv() method to Imager::Color
   Thanks to Leolo (Philip Gwyn)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65385

 - split libt1 Type 1 font support into a sub-module
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)

 - add a preload() class method for use in forking servers, and to
   work around limitations in PAR.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65665

Bug fixes:

 - paletted writes to a masked image are now masked correctly.
   Revealed by new coverage tests.

 - update the filter plugin documentation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=56513

 - add the matrix() method to Imager::Matrix2d to allow creation of a
   matrix with specified co-efficients.  You can now multiple an
   Imager::Matrix2d object by a 9 element array ref or a number.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29938

 - really fix loading TTF fonts with FT2 when FT1 isn't available.
   Thanks to Leolo (Philip Gwyn)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65386
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62855

 - make sure each test script that needs testout/ creates it.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65088

 - handle a slightly different warning from libtiff 4.x
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65268

 - the sat transform2() op returned an incorrect saturation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65391

Imager 0.80 - 17 Jan 2011
===========

 - added coverage tests for Imager::Fountain and Imager::Color::Float

 - Imager is now maintained in git
   http://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git
   git://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git

Bug fixes:

 - images with an translucent alpha channel were not scaled correctly
   by the default (qtype=normal) scaling method.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=63922

 - Imager::Color::Float now translates "#FFFFFF" to white instead of
   just a little darker.

 - make the default color map build algorithm "mediancut".  This
   changes the default color map builder for writing GIFs back to what
   it was in 0.77, reverting a performance regression.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=64785

 - handle failure to create a masked image correctly

Imager 0.79 - 10 Dec 2010
===========

 - add Imager::Test to the POD coverage tests and document the missing
   functions.

 - the convert() method now optimizes the case where all output
   channels are either 0, sourced from a single input channel or 1.
   This significantly speeds up presets like "addalpha", "green".
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51254

 - add wiggle.pl sample, as suggested by Dan Oppenheim.

 - add the combine() method to combine channels from multiple source
   images into a new image
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11872

Bug fixes:

 - treat the co-efficients for convert() as doubles instead of floats.

 - If a higher (earlier) priority font handler failed to load, that
   would crash preventing loading of later font handlers.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62855

 - parse defines from the options returned by pkg-config --cflags
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63223

 - a regen of the MANIFEST revealed that GIF and FT2 tests weren't
   included in the tarball.  They are now included.

Imager 0.78 - 4 Oct 2010
===========

Bug fixes:

 - don't access deprecated members of the png_structp.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60242

 - document that using color objects is faster than supplying colors
   by name, etc.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=61047

 - Imager::Probe now accepts array references for incpath and libpath.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60244

Imager 0.77_02 - 27 Sep 2010
==============

 - moved Win32, FreeType 2 font support into sub-modules.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)
   Uses Imager::Probe now.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61328

 - tested successfully with jpeg-8b
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60221

Bug fixes:

 - from _01: look for missing file support test files in the right
   places.

 - flood_fill() wouldn't fill the right side of a single scan-line
   fill area.
   Thanks to Nicolas Roggli for reporting this.

 - flood_fill wouldn't fill to the left edge of the image if the
   starting line didn't reach the left edge.
   Thanks to Nicolas Roggli for reporting this.

Imager 0.77_01 - 13 Sep 2010
==============

 - add each library-directory/pkgconfig/ to the pkg-config search path
   in Imager::Probe.
   Thanks to Justin Davis.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60491

 - moved GIF, TIFF, JPEG file handling code into sub-modules in
   preparation for separate distribution.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)

 - optimize filled box drawing (color, not fill)

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Probe was calling ExtUtils::Liblist to initialize
   LD_RUN_PATH supplying an undefined value rather than the found
   directory.  Thanks to Justin Davis.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60491

 - only prepend ./ to font filenames when passing them to T1Lib and
   then only when it would use its search mechanisms.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60509

 - fix the cache check for the X rgb.txt loader.  This is typically
   used for color translation on Unix-like systems, and the fix
   improves performance of supplying colors by name by about 80 times.
   Test code that managed 3400 10x10 pixel boxes/second sped up to
   25700 boxes/second.

 - clarify that Imager doesn't write EXIF metadata to images.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60637

 - Imager::Probe can now search subdirectories under its include path.
   Used by the PNG Makefile.PL to find headers and libraries when they
   aren't in the base directory, as in cygwin.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60635

Imager 0.77 - 11 Aug 2010
===========

I don't want Imager::File::PNG indexed as part of Imager, but forgot
to update the META.yml before updating the version.

 - don't index Imager::File::PNG as part of Imager

 - add resources to META.yml

Imager 0.76 - not released
===========

Bug fixes:

 - the align_string() method would ignore a string of "0" due to a
   mis-use of C< ||= >.
   Thanks to Maurice Height for reporting this.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60199

Imager 0.75_03 - 09 Aug 2010
==============

Bug fixes:

 - read_types() and write_types() would include png when it wasn't
   available due to a problem with the %formats tie

 - handle dependent libraries correctly (eg -lpng requiring -lz) in
   the code run phase of library probing.

Imager 0.75_02 - 07 Aug 2010
==============

Bug fixes:

 - add file missing from MANIFEST, which was causing TIFF failures.

Imager 0.75_01 - 06 Aug 2010
==============

Test release for the new PNG probe.

 - added the ability to read multiple-image PNM files.
   Note that unlike the pbm/pgm/ppm specification this accepts mixed
   format files and allows white space padding between files.
   Thanks to Philip Gwyn (Leolo) for this patch.

 - moved the PNG file handling code into a sub-module in preparation
   for separate distribution.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)
   Also helps avoid complications from -I/-L compile/link options from
   other libraries.

Bugs:

 - Imager->new(data => $data) didn't try to process image file data in
   $data
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58761

 - t/t50basicoo.t no longer depends on the other tests to generate its 
   input files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9798
   Also, it wasn't testing pnm (pnm vs ppm mix-up)

 - update the documentation of hardinvert to match the change in 0.62.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=59785

 - added hardinvertall filter which also inverts the alpha channel
   (sorry for the mess)

 - when probing for TIFF, set LD_RUN_PATH just as the Makefile does so
   the probe can find the library for the test run.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57518

Imager 0.75 - 20 Jun 2010
===========

 - use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT to slightly improve performance on threaded
   perls (not measured)

Bugs:

 - an opacity fill based on a fountain fill would segfault when
   filling an 8-bit/sample image.

 - merge thickline branch polygon fix
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43518

Imager 0.74 - 7 May 2010
===========

Bug fixes:

 - read_multi() didn't handle a missing file format library correctly,
   aborting on failing to call i_readgif_multi_wiol() or
   i_readtiff_multi_wiol().

 - fix spelling errors patched by Debian
   http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/pkg-perl/trunk/libimager-perl/debian/patches/spelling.patch?revision=54839&view=markup

 - add an (unshipped) author test to spellcheck Imager's POD.

 - update the TIFF file format documentation
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=56510

 - lib/Imager/IO.pod was written almost 4 years ago but never shipped.

Imager 0.73 - 15 Mar 2010
===========

 - implement outline circles, both anti-aliased and not
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19755

 - a combine => "none" fill to a 1 or 3 channel image would produce
   the incorrect colour.

Imager 0.72 - 09 Dec 2009
===========

Bump version for release, since 0.71_03 is stable with CPAN testers.

Imager 0.71_03 - 5 Dec 2009
==============

 - further adjust the threads test so it only performs the tests on
   perls where it's expected to work, and only if the threads module
   can be loaded.

Imager 0.71_02 - 1 Dec 2009
==============

 - adjust the way we load the threads module for the threads test so
   it works with non-threaded perls

Imager 0.71_01 - 30 Nov 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - use scanline oriented operations to flip images instead of pixel
   operations
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39278

 - use double/sample operations to flip large sample images instead of
   8-bit sample operations.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39280

 - fix POD nits
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51874

 - prevent double-frees when someone creates Imager objects and then
   creates a thread.  Note: this just handles some simple cases,
   Imager doesn't support perl threads, and isn't likely to.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52268

Imager 0.71 - 16 Nov 2009
===========

 - add the opacity fill type - an adaptor that modifies the opacity of
   another fill.

Bug fixes:

 - the conv filter now enforces that the sum of the coefficients is
   non-zero.  Also, rather than skipping pixels off the edge off the
   edge of the image, the closest edge pixel is used.  Previously
   dividing by the zero sum of coefficients could cause invalid
   results or runtime exceptions.
   Thanks to David Cantrell's Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box for revealing
   this bug.

Imager 0.70 - 21 Sep 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - release image row and comments memory on all error returns in gif
   reader

 - handle zero length extensions, previously this would cause a null
   pointer dereference
   Thanks to Krzysztof Wojtaś for the test data and fix for this.

 - an integer division meant that preview scaling to below 1 pixel
   wide or high (which isn't too useful anyway) was calculating using
   NaNs on most platforms, and causing an exception on others.
   Thanks to David Cantrell for producing a backtrace of the crash on
   his Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box which made it possible to track this
   down.

Imager 0.69 - 08 Sep 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - broken test fix - was attempting to call a function skip_all, when
   that should be a parameter to plan().

 - briefly document apidocs.perl, the tool used to build
   Imager::APIRef and make some minor enhancements

 - various minor documentation enhancements and fixes.

Imager 0.68 - 07 Sep 2009
===========

 - Imager->new(file => $filename) and other similar incantations will
   load the given file.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48261

Bug fixes:

 - avoid using CHECK as a label in Imager::Test
   http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5220921

 - re-work most image file test files that require a library into
   separate library present/not present files to remove stupidly long
   conditionals

 - don't treat rubthrough() outside the bounds of the target image as
   an error.
   http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5185716

Imager 0.67_01 - 02 Sep 2009
==============

Bug fixes:

 - correct documentation of default of raw image interleave read
   parameter
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=42074

 - add raw_ prefix to raw read parameters, though the original names
   still work.

 - fail the read if an invalid raw_interleave parameter is supplied

 - warn if no interleave or raw_interleave parameter is supplied,
   since the documented default was wrong, and incompatible with the
   write format

 - for reading raw images, if raw_storechannels > raw_datachannels,
   set the extra channels in the image to 0

 - when probing for executables like freetype-config, search for .bat
   and .cmd on MSWin32, as well as .exe.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49275

 - re-work the external libraries section of README:
   - list Debian and Redhat package names for each library
   - reformatting
   - update URLs

 - use the new EU::MM META_MERGE facility instead of generating
   META.yml from scratch
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47888

 - use Devel::CheckLib (bundled, modified) to check which release of
   libtiff is installed and reject 3.9.0
   http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2088
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543079

Imager 0.67 - 12 Dec 2008
===========

Bug fixes:

 - fix a packaging error

Imager 0.66 - 12 Dec 2008
===========

 - 24-bit color .ICO/.CUR files can now be read.

Bug fixes:

 - an optimization skipping 0 src alpha values could cause the
   rubthrough() to read past the end of a buffer.
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1509184.html

 - corrected a reference leak where writing GIFs would leak memory.
   This could also happen calling to_paletted().
   Also documented the underlying long existing feature where the
   colors parameter is filled with the generated color table and added
   tests for it.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41028

 - write out the image size in bytes field of a BMP correctly.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41406

 - add limited tests for Imager::ExtUtils

 - make Imager::ExtUtils->includes use an absolute path, since
   a relative path could cause failures using Inline::C.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37353

 - re-arrange the POD for Imager::Font::BBox:
   - mark total_width(), pos_width(), end_offset() obsolete, since
     they're mostly for backwards compatibility
   - group width methods and height methods
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39999

Imager 0.65 - 20 May 2008
===========

Bug fixes:

 - In some cases when an error occurs reading those parts of a JPEG
   file after the image the scan-line buffer could be freed a second
   time.  In cases where the the error occured while reading the image
   data it's possible that the buffer could have leaked.
   Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this and help in tracking
   it down.

 - the gif_screen_height tag was overriding the screen width and being
   ignored for the screen height when present.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=35568

Imager 0.64 - 23 April 2008
===========

This is a bug fix release.  This includes a fix for a possible
security issue.

Bug fixes:

 - Possible security issue: The floating point sample path for image
   based fills had a buffer overflow.  This would overwrite the end of
   a malloc()ed buffer with double precision floats.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35324
   CVE-2008-1928

 - check that the result of fileno($fh) is defined rather than simply
   true when read() or write() is supplied with an fh parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35139

 - i_scale_axis() wasn't checking the result of i_img_new_ch()
   resulting in a SIGSEGV when attempting to scale an image to a size
   too large to fit in memory.  This is a NULL pointer access issue,
   not a buffer overflow.
   Added a check for the failure.
   scale_calculate() (and hence scale()) will now fail if any of the
   scale size parameters are a reference.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35172

 - Regression: filling a greyscale image with a hatch used the wrong
   color channels from the supplied fg/bg colors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35278

 - fixed a related problem for image fills.

Imager 0.63 - 7 April 2008
===========

This release primarily contains changes to improve ease of use -
rather than you having to convert images to the appropriate number of
channels, Imager handles it internally.  How to handle drawing colors
and the default combine mode is a thornier problem left for some other
release.

 - the font libraries are now only initialized when needed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28825

 - moved the imtoc.perl code into Imager::Preprocess

 - paste() and rubthrough() now adapt the source image data to the
   destination, so you can now safely paste/rubthrough from greyscale
   images to color images or back, or from alpha channel images to
   noalpha channels or back.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30908

 - rubthrough() now falls back to pasting when the source doesn't have
   an alpha channel.  This effectively treats the source as having a
   max alpha channel, the right thing to do.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29944

 - re-worked most of the area filling code to use a common set of
   functions when filling.
   Corrected normal combine mode.
   Rewrote most of the combine modes to match the way the SVG draft
   defines them with respect to a translucent source and destination.
   Added tests for translucent source and destination.
   Added tests to check 8-bit/sample and double/sample combines work
   similarly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29879

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a JPEG file will now write that
   image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29876

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a PGM/PPM file will now write
   that image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30074

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a BMP file will now write that
   image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30075

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Matrix2d->translate() now only requires one of the x or y
   parameters.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29937

 - mixing qtype scaling now sets all channels of a pixel to zero if
   the pixel has zero coverage (zero alpha).  This should produce more
   compressible output files.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32324

 - removed the pointless #! line from lib/Imager/Font/Wrap.pm
   Noticed when I saw:
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=166254
   I'm not changing the #! lines of the sample code, since it's sample
   code, not intended for installation.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33408

 - some TGA images weren't being detected correctly as TGA images
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32925

 - handling of the left-over bit for 16-bit/pixel TGA images has been
   changed to match the behaviour of the GIMP.  Previously the bit
   being set was treated as an opaque pixel, but one user reported a
   problem with loading such an image.  I haven't been able to find any
   tools beyond the GIMP that handle alpha-channel 16-bit TGAs, so
   I'll match it's behaviour.  See issue 114913 in the GIMP's
   bugzilla.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32926

Imager 0.62 - 10 December 2007
===========

 - Makefile.PL now expands ~/path supplied to --incpath or --libpath
   to /path under your home directory.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29484

 - the old dynaload code used Mach API functions to load dynamic
   libraries on Mac OS X.  These APIs have been deprecated in OS X
   10.5 and were causing some build problems.
   So henceforth Imager uses the dlopen() family of functions, and you 
   will need version 10.3 or later of OS X.

 - added the det() function to the transform2() engine.
   added the sample quad_to_square.pl
   Courtesy Richard Fairhurst.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31244

Bug fixes:

 - samples/gifscale.pl sourced the base value for gif_top from
   gif_left.
   Thanks to Eleneldil G. Arilou for pointing this out.

 - t/t82inline.t no longer loads B at runtime, to work around a bug
   in some 5.005_0[45] installations.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30508

 - work around Module::Depends::Intrusive bug #21229
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30520

 - the hardinvert filter no-longer inverts the alpha channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30002

 - the hardinvert filter now supports large samples

Imager 0.61_02 - 28 November 2007
==============

 - major TIFF support re-work
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20329

 - added a C level image interface for accessing samples from 1-32
   bits, exposed this at the perl level in getsamples()

 - the conv filter now works at floating point precision for high bit
   images

 - added is_bilevel method to test whether an image should be written as
   a bilevel image if the image format supports it.

 - added -log-stderr as an Imager import list option

 - added some important types to Imager::APIRef

 - added test_image_double() to Imager::Test

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Fountain couldn't read GIMP gradient files with 10 or more
   segments

 - the scale() method with qtype mixing now handles images with an
   alpha channel correctly.

 - fixed a broken link from the "animated GIF" entry in the concept index.
   Thanks to Slaven Rezic.

 - on some perl's the infix expression parser test would fail due to
   actions in the grammar returning false.  Made sure all actions return
   a true value.
   Thanks to Richard Fairhurst for spending a lot of time in tracking
   down this problem.

Imager 0.61 - 5 November 2007
===========

 - added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags
   when scaling an animated gif
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27591

Bug fixes:

 - correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow
   perspective type transformations to work now.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29936

 - prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c
   also fixed some other type warnings
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30204

 - some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent
   directory tests
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30203

 - Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos
   thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29771

 - test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to
   use long double.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29413

 - the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break.
   Added tests for better code coverage of the ops.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29296

 - the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30334

 - the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values
   under 0x10000.  This was most noticable when writing large RLE images.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30335

 - validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp()
   implementations.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28985

 - attempt to work around the test failure at 
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29562

 - improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write
   an unknown image file format.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30103

 - improve the transform2() documentation
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29267

 - correctly generate the author key in META.yml
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30377

 - correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when
   performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel.
   Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output
   image.

Imager 0.60 - 30 August 2007
===========

 - Finished/rewrote Arnar's old SGI RGB file format support, so Imager
   now has full SGI RGB image format, including RLE and 16-bit/sample
   images.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8666

 - logging functions are now available in the API

 - applied Gabriel Vasseur's patch
   added documentation, further tests, and support for greyscale images
   Obviously problems are my fault :)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28142

 - the mask for ICO/CUR images is now applied as an alpha channel to
   the returned image.  For the old behaviour, supply ico_masked => 0
   to read() or read_multi().  This should be less confusing when
   using Imager as a general image processor.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29001

Bug fixes:

 - in some cases it's possible for giflib/libungif to return color 
   indexes outside the range of colors defined by the image's palette.
   We now expand the palette to match the indexes used.
   Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this.

 - fixed various memory leaks that could occur when failing to read png,
   jpeg, bmp or tga files.

 - to avoid confusion, channels not present in the image are returned as
   zero by getscanline().  This has no effect on the C level i_glin()
   and i_glinf() API functions which continue to not set the unused
   channels.

 - the convert() method now returns an image of the same sample size as
   the source image.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28492

 - remove repeated text in Imager::Files
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27589

 - be even more explicit that scale() and friends don't modify the source
   image, but return a new image.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28570

 - improve the error message from errstr() when you try to load a font
   for which the driver hasn't been built in Imager.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27571

 - transparency is now enabled by default when writing GIF images
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27615

 - Imager would not load on Windows 98
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27653

Imager 0.59 - 14 June 2007
===========

Bug fixes:

 - fixes a regression introduced by the fixes for RT 11972
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27546

 - cropping outside the image would return an Imager object with
   no low-level image object, instead of returning false.
   Fixed by: Philip Gwyn (Leolo)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27509

Imager 0.58 - 16 May 2007
===========

No significant changes from 0.57_01.

Imager 0.57_01 - 11 May 2007
==============

 - added to_rgb16 to produce a 16-bit/sample version of an image

 - improve freetype 1.x text output efficiency

Bug fixes:

 - search another place for rgb.txt, and check all the places 
   Imager::Color checks when deciding whether to skip testing it
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26064

 - use a convolution kernel size based on the stddev rather than a
   fixed size when performing a gaussian blur
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25645

 - document the difference() method's mindist parameter, and debug it.

 - put the Imager release number in the Inline::C generated code to
   regenerate Inline code when a new release of Imager is installed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26278

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 1.x driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the T1lib driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reworked library probing, we can now set more than one probe
   function for a library.  Disabled the default (non-freetype-config)
   library probe and added an extra probe function that searches for
   both ft2build.h and whatever it includes, and adds -I as needed.
   Hopefully this will fix build problems like
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/05/msg472281.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26086

Imager 0.57 - 30 Apr 2007
===========

This is a maintenence release fixing a security issue in Imager.

 - CRITICAL: a specially crafted compressed BMP file can cause a buffer
   overflow in malloced memory.  There will be further discussion of
   this issue in the ticket below.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26811
   CVE-2007-2459  CVE-2007-2413
   The descriptions at cve.mitre.org varied in quality, please see the
   ticket at rt.cpan.org for a more accurate description of the issue.

Imager 0.56 - 1 Apr 2007
===========

 - added support for reading 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - improved performance of reading PBM/PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing PBM images if the image is paletted and
   contains only black and white

 - added a new make_colors value - "mono"

 - switched from the svn log Changes to a manual Changes to reduce
   noise

 - new sample code - samples/flasher.pl

Bug fixes:

 - CRITICAL: the "Imager" typemap entry (not used by Imager itself)
   was returning an image object with an extra reference, this
   resulted in a memory leak.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24992

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 2.x driver
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reading bmp files now consitently handles short reads.  You can now
   supply a parameter to treat a short read as successful and set
   i_incomplete
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8426

 - previously, reading ASCII PBM files required spaces between samples,
   even though the format doesn't require that

 - improved documentation of the unsharpmask filter (I hope)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25531

 - force flushing of the output from i_tt_dump_names() and test output
   in t/t35ttfont.t to prevent output from being mixed up.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24859

 - rewrite a conditional expression as an if() to hopefully work around
   a bug in the pre-4.0 GCC Apple shipped with OS X 10.4.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25561

 - avoid Data::Dumper in regops.perl to support older releases of perl
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24391

Imager 0.55 - 16 Dec 2006
===========

This is primarily a bug fix release.

Note: Test::More is now a pre-requisite for Imager and is no longer bundled.

There is one new feature:

 - the Win32 font driver now supports UTF8 (RT 22166)
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22166

Several bugs were fixed:

 - the string() method would not output the string "0"
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - fills.c was failing to compile on Solaris 10 (compiler unknown)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21944

 - the gif_disposal and gif_user_input tags weren't being read from
   the file correctly
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=22192

 - gif.c was failing to build under MSVC
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23922

 - in some cases strings passed to the string() method were treated as
   terminated by NUL (chr 0)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - on "MSWin32" perl builds we now link to -lzlib instead of -lz since
   that's the default build name for zlib on Win32.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23064

 - search $Config{incpath} for headers too, which we should have been
   doing all along.

Win32 font driver fixes:

 - the global descent value from bounding box was the wrong sign
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276

 - if the first or last glyph overflowed the left or right side of the
   advance width they would be clipped


Imager 0.54 - 14 Sep 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release:

 - a new qtype value 'mixing' has been added to the scale()
   method. This is faster than 'normal', slower than 'preview'. This
   is based on the method used by pnmscale, and seems to produce less
   blurry results than normal.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20677

 - the rubthrough() method can now render onto images with an alpha
   channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20678

 - the read_multi() method now falls back to calling doing a single
   image read via the read() method and write_multi() will now fall
   back to calling write() if a single image is supplied. This means
   you can simply call the read_multi() or write_multi() functions
   without having to check if the type is formatted by that method.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19457
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19458

 - the GIF loop extension can now be written. If you don't have
   libungif/giflib 4.1.4 (or some distribution's bugfixed equivalent) you
   should upgrade.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21185

 - getscanline() and setscanline() can now read/write palette index
   based data from/to the image for paletted images, by setting type to
   'index'.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20338

 - we no longer hassle you to disable GIF support
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20687

 - minor documentation fixes


Imager 0.53 - 26 Jul 2006
===========

This is a bugfix release.

Some test code was left in a code path not covered by the test
suite. A test was added to cover this code path and the test code was
removed.
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20705


Imager 0.52 - 25 Jul 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release, but contains a fair few bug
fixes, new features:

 - ability to read and write MS Windows ICO and CUR files

 - you can now add file format plugins to support new file formats

 - add POD coverage tests

 - setcolors() and addcolors() now accept color names and so on
   instead of requiring Imager::Color objects.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20056

 - flood_fill() can now fill to a specified border color instead of
   just to the area the same color as the seed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19618


Bug fixes:

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't converting UTF8 to ascii when
   calculating the advance width.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20554

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't including leading and
   trailing spaces in the bounding box as the other drivers did, it also
   produced strange results for empty strings or strings containing only
   spaces

 - when reading CMYK jpeg images they were being transferred to the
   image object as is, producing a four channel image. It only looked ok
   due to an old still unfixed Photoshop bug. We now convert from the
   inverted CMYK that photoshop (and Corel for example) produce into RGB.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20416

 - reading a CYMK TIFF would result in a 4 channel image, reading any
   image with more than 4 channels (eg. RGB with 2 alpha channels) would
   result in an error.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20415

 - added /usr/local/include to the default include search path, since
   we were already searching /usr/local/lib for libraries.

And various minor fixes and documentation updates.


Imager 0.51 - 23 Apr 2006
===========

 - fix a validation bug when processing JPEG EXIF data that can cause
   a crash
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18496

 - fix mis-processing of the src_maxx and src_maxy parameters of the
   paste() method
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18712

 - fix a problem in Imager's "smart" handling of the color parameter
   to various methods.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18561


Imager 0.50 - 29 Mar 2006
===========

 - CRITICAL: fixes a segmentation fault from attempting to write a 2
   or 4 channel image to jpeg or a 2 channel image to tga where the
   output is an in-memeory buffer.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18397

 - fixes an incorrect pointer parameter in the PNG code
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18051

 - skip Inline::C tests when building in a directory with spaces
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18049
