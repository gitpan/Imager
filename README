========================
1. Patent infringements?
========================

Imager as such contains no patented algorithms.  The external
libraries (which are not written by me) may or may not contain
patented algorithms.  YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING
LICENSE(S) TO USE SUCH LIBRARIES SHOULD YOU NEED ANY.


========================
2. Compiling and testing
========================

Some care has been taken to make the installation as smooth as
possible.  This is rather hard due to the difference between operating
systems and site setups.  To get started just type

$ perl Makefile.PL

It should blurb out a list of which libraries were found and which
not.  If you add a library to the machine after installing Imager it
does not automatically become available in Imager.  It only uses the
libraries that are found.  If the list of found libraries is not what
you expected, then the Makefile.PL is either not searching in the
right directories or your box does not have the libraries you think it
does.  For a list of where to get the libraries have a look at
3. External dependencies.  To widen the search path for libraries and
include files set the IM_INCPATH and IM_LIBPATH variables.  The
environment variables that matter when Makefile.PL is run are

IM_INCPATH      colon separated list of paths to extra include files
IM_LIBPATH      colon separated list of paths to extra library files

IM_VERBOSE      turns on verbose mode for the library scanning and such
IM_MANUAL       to manually select which libraries are used and which not
IM_NOLOG        if true logging will not be compiled into the module
IM_DEBUG_MALLOC if true malloc debugging will be compiled into the module
                do not use IM_DEBUG_MALLOC in production - this slows
                everything down

When finding the libraries has been sorted out it's time for

$ make 

and if that works then do

$ make test

If either fails do take a peek at the file errop.perl.  It's creates a
file report.txt.  This is some information which will help me discover
where the problem is so I can try to fix it in future releases.  If
you find running it ok (just remember - no warranty!) please send the
report.txt via email to addi@umich.edu .  If it worked just continue
with the installation as normally (with make install).

========================
3. External dependencies
========================

Some hints about getting the Imager module to find the libraries it
needs for specific features.  The libraries it uses are:

 jpeg: ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

  png: ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png  
  you also need zlib to use png:  ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/zlib

  gif: http://www.arrakeen.demon.co.uk/giflib/  
or at: http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/giflib.shtml

   t1: ftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pub/software/t1lib/
or at: ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/

   tt: http://www.freetype.org/

Precompiled versions of some of the libraries might be found at:

AIX:

   ftp://ftp.rge.com/pub/systems/aix/bull/



========================
4. Logging and debugging
========================

Logging is compiled in by default - if you should want to get of it
from the binaries you can do so by setting the env IMAGER_NOLOG 
to something. If you want to enable malloc debugging to check for leaks
then set IMAGER_DEBUG_MALLOC to something.  Needless to say it is
pretty pointless to have malloc debug enabled with no logging since you 
can never see the malloc information that way.


========================
5. Truetype information
========================

If you enable the truetype part and want it to be TESTED you MUST set
the environment variable TTFONTTEST to a complete path to a truetype
font.


=======================
6. General information
=======================

The Imager module homepage is currently at:

 http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~addi/perl/Imager/

The current docs are rather bad as I've been busy adding features
but hopefully they will be updated soon.  Until then you'll just
have to use the source. The test scripts might also be a good idea.
By activating the the #init_log lines in the test script you can get
rather verbose debugging output from the C code.
