This doc desscribes some hints about getting
the Imager module to find the libraries it needs for specific
image file formats.

The libraries it uses are:

 jpeg: ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

  png: ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png  
  you also need zlib to use png:  ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/zlib

  gif: http://www.arrakeen.demon.co.uk/giflib/  
or at: http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/giflib.shtml

   t1: ftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pub/software/t1lib/t1lib-0.9.tar.gz. 
or at: ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/t1lib-0.9.tar.gz 

=================

Logging is compiled in by default - if you should want to get of it
from the binaries you can do so by setting the env IMAGER_NOLOG 
to something. If you want to enable malloc debugging to check for leaks
then set IMAGER_DEBUG_MALLOC to something.  Needless to say it is
pretty pointless to have malloc debug enabled with no logging.

=================

The Imager module homepage is currently at:

 http://gauss.mbl.is/~amh/Imager/

The current docs are rather bad as I've been busy adding features
but hopefully they will be updated soon.  Until then you'll just
have to use the source. The test scripts might also be a good idea.
By activating the the #init_log lines in the test script you can get
rather verbose debugging output from the C code.

Thanks go to Claes, Schwern, Tkil, Sky, Merlyn, lucs, PerlJam, Veblen, Dngor,
Gbarr, Mjd, Jerome and Jalex and anyone else in case I forgot someone.
